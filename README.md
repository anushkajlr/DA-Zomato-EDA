# Restaurant Search Engine

Searching for restaurants on the current Zomato app is purely based on dish and restaurant names. Our goal at the end of this project is to provide a recommendation system not limited by these constraints. We want the user to be able to write down what they are searching for in a restaurant and based on these requirements provide users with the restaurants with their criteria.

To determine the facilities provided by the restaurant at the customer level we will be making use of customer reviews as they best represent what someone can expect at a restaurant. For example, if one types in ‘Fun Outings’ we want to be able to display all restaurants that may cater to this need and display them to the user

## Requirements

The following libraries are required to run the code:

1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Sklearn
4. Seaborn
5. Matplotlib
6. Plotly
7. Wordcloud
8. Nltk
9. Keras
10. Tensorflow
11. Genism
